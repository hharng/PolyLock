# About
Encryption is handled with [chaeslib](https://pypi.org/project/Chaeslib/), obfuscation is handled by my fork of [hyperion](https://github.com/therealOri/Hyperion/). and compilation is handled by [nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/). You can provide any .py file you like, PolyLock will then encrypt the file's data and then obfuscate it. You will then be asked if you want to compile the .py to an executable and if you say yes, you will be left with either a linux executable binary, a .exe, or whatever you get on Mac OS. Making sure your code is secure and obfuscated.
